# Expanding Macros

Use `cargo expand` to inspect the code generated by macros. This is essential when debugging or verifying macro invocations.

// turbo-all

1. Expand macros using the `/build` workflow pattern:
```bash
export MUJOCO_DYNAMIC_LINK_DIR=$(realpath mujoco-*/lib) && export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(realpath mujoco-*/lib/) && cargo expand > expanded.rs

```

> [!NOTE]
> - The output file `expanded.rs` is `.gitignore`d.
> - After expanding, search `expanded.rs` for the generated methods to verify correctness.
